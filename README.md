# Goal
To apply knowledge of JavaScript techniques to implement the front end functionality for a social media application

# Brief
You have been tasked with producing a new JavaScript front end client for an existing social media platform. The client application must be attractive and responsive, but you have an otherwise blank slate in terms of theme design language.

Using the provided API and API documentation, create a functioning user interface that allows for viewing, posting, editing and deleting social media content.

Social API routes require authorization via JWT (JSON Web Tokens). You will need to register an account and login to access your token.

In order to complete the required features you will also need to make use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.

Using localStorage is highly recommended, especially for storing JWT tokens.

A finished project fulfills the requirements below with an easy to use and error-free user interface

# Process
1. Create or select one repository to use throughout this project.
2. Create a js2 branch from the default master or main branch.
3. You may use either Trello or GitHub Projects to manage your development tasks. If you are using Trello please make sure that your board is public and that a link is provided in your readme.md file. Make sure to detail tasks accurately and divide them evenly if working a group.

Examples of overly vague tasks:

* Make the HTML for the post page
* Website Styling
* JavaScript for API
* Test the website

Examples of detailed & accurate tasks:

* Create search form HTML
* Search form SCSS styling
* Filter posts function
* Implement search event listener
* Review the API Guide and API Documentation.
* Plan your approach, desired features and work strategy.
* Implement the required features as per your work plan.
